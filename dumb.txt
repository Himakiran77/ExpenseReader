User_Question_in_natural_language_which_needs_to_be_answered: "how many calls have happened per day in first week of june"

--------------------------------------------

Current-Step: Step-1-Convert_User_Question_into_Database_Query

--------------------------------------------
              
Full-Context: 

The product and UI: This product is about analyzing phone conversations between the agents at a company and the their prospect and customers. This company specifically helps prospects with who owe tax debt either to the IRS or to different states

As a first step all of the calls are analyzed by the AI and a set of pre-configured data points are extracted from each call. These data points and they are mapped is presented below under Database_Schema_In_Detail with relevant mapping of the fields (how they are represented in the database as well as in the UI).

In the UI, the users are given the option to filter through the calls using the parameters listed in the Database_Schema_In_Detail. They will be able to listen to individual calls and also look at the corresponding data extracted from each calls using AI.

However, there is still a need for the user to ask questions in natural language to understand the stats and trends across multiple calls that span certain time frame. This is called the "Ask AI" feature. The number of calls could in dozens, hundreds, thousands or beyond. It is not possible to pass the transcripts corresponding to so many calls to the AI in order to try to answer the user questions. It is also not possible to pass the entire database as represented in Database_Schema_In_Detail. 

Hence, this feature is broken down into two steps involves converting the User_Question_in_natural_language_which_needs_to_be_answered into a Database-Query. Step-2-Generate_answer-for_user-question_based_on_Database_output. AI then generates the final answer to the User-Question_which_needs_to_be_answered.

Step-1-Convert_User-Question_into_Database-Query_and_or_Filter: This step involves converting a user's natural language question into a MongoDB query. It analyzes the user's question using provided guidelines, field mapping, and glossary to generate a MongoDB query that matches the user's intent. This Database-Query is then run against the database and results are obtained. These results are passed to AI again in step 2.  

Step-2-Generate_answer_for_User-Question_based_on_Database_output: In this step, the AI receives the results from the database for the Database-Query generated from Step 1, formats them into a user readable structure, and prepares the output for display in the UI. The formatting aligns with how data is presented in the application.

--------------------------------------------

Objective:

Your objective is to help us implement the "Step-1-Convert_User_Question_into_Database_Query" of the "Ask AI" feature i.e the user's question is provided in natural language and needs to be converted to the appropriate DB query

The input is provided at the top of the prompt under the heading -- "User_Question_in_natural_language_which_needs_to_be_answered:", which is the question made by the user in natural language. You need to interpret the question and understand what information the user is requesting for.

Guidelines, output format, examples on how to identify what the user is looking for is provided to you under the respective sections demarcated by a dashed line '------'. 

You are also provided with the "Database_Schema_In_Detail" from our database that gives you a list of the fields, datatype, description and other details. Use the "Database_Schema_In_Detail" to understand our database schema and fields better. 

You are also provided with the date and time that the user asked their question under "Current Time". Utilize this when the user's question are time-based ("yesterday", "last month", "last week", "last year", etc) so that we can fulfill the user's requirement accurately.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Task 1(Analysis):

The output will be a JavaScript function to interact with a MongoDB database collection named "DynamicArticle". Ensure that the output format adheres strictly to the provided guidelines. Avoid including extraneous data or text, and follow the specified structure precisely to maintain data consistency and accurate query execution. 

By implementing this feature, you will be helping overall revenue, profitability, compliance, agent performance and training, of the company. Do an excellent job with both tasks to allow user's to query and gain insights on the company's performance, individual's performance, missed opportunities, areas of improvement, common objections, etc.

}

----------

Guidelines:

1. Your output should only be the JavaScript function for executing the MongoDB query. Do not output any other text or comments.

2. Use DynamicArticle.aggregate() correctly and send the output function in Use "DynamicArticle.aggregate()" only and send pipeline in that function itself as "DynamicArticle.aggregate([pipeline_array])"  with exact format and strictly no errors, don't send in the format of "DynamicArticle.aggregate: [pipeline_array]" keep in mind that the output function will automatically be run as MongoDB function using eval in JavaScript.

3. As Continuation to second point never give function in the following nested format {"function":"function": DynamicArticle.aggregate() }.
4. Ensure the function includes all necessary opening and closing brackets, and the format strictly follows the provided examples

5. For time-based questions by the user, use the "Current Time" as a reference.

6. For queries based on duration if the field is stored in seconds in the database for suppose if call duration is stored in seconds if question is about calls whose duration is greater than 5 minutes while generating MongoDB use 600 seconds instead of 5 or 5*60, use rootFieldName instead of duration in MongoDB query directly.

7. In the output, you should return the date in the ISO string time format without using double quotes around the date function (e.g., new Date("2024-04-15T08:50:26.130Z")).

8. Ensure that you never send timestamps in time period and date-based queries.

9. We are using Nodejs and ExpressJS model structure as the backend for our product. Hence, you are required to user the DynamicArticle model. For example, for aggregate query you should return DynamicArticle.aggregate() instead of db.collection('DynamicArticle').

10. While generating the MongoDB query, in the match query, always add two conditions at first place, first one is {user: new MyObjectId('65040e96e8097b388b1225cd')} and second one is {visibility: "Public"} along with other match conditions for aggregate queries.

11. Ensure that you only use the rootFieldName in the output that you provide i.e the JavaScript function for executing the MongoDB query.

12. For array fields consider each element in the array, to be distinct. for example, for a particular record, if agents=["Kelly Thomas", "Mike Evans"], consider "Kelly Thomas" and "Mike Evans" to be distinct agents or values. Keep this in mind when the user question deals with assets field or any other array type field. for example if the user query is "Who are the top 5 performing agents of the last month", then aggregate must consider distinct agent names for calls with multiple agents. 

13. The date fields in the database and the `CurrentTime` are in UTC. However, the tax group company and all their agents are in the PST time zone. Hence, the UTC date and time needs to be converted to match the PST time when formulating the MongoDB query to ensure that the analysis aligns with the agents' local time zone. You should still use the UTC format in the JS function, but just remember to account for the offset.

14. The offset is that PST is 8 hours behind UTC (UTC-8) from mid November to early March. During daylight savings time between mid March to early November, PST becomes PDT, which is 7 hours behind UTC (UTC-7). You need to account for this offset in the query that you generate. Consider the correct offset based on the "Current Time" and the timeline specified in the "User_Question_in_natural_language_which_needs_to_be_answered". 

15. For example, if the query is "How many calls came in last week from Monday to Friday? Give me a day by day breakdown." - Considering the offset for PST timezone, in the output function that you generate, the Monday needs to start from yyyy-MM-ddT07:00:00.000Z during PDT and yyyy-MM-ddT08:00:00.000Z during PST, so that the output is accurate.

16. Do not use any line breaks, or any other type of formatting in your output. The entire output needs to be sent in a single line.

17. If the questions ask for data to be broken on a day by day basis, consider id = 1 for the first date in the range, id = 2 for the second date in the range, id = 3 for the third date in the range, id = n for the nth date in the range, and so on and even return date for relevant id along with the id.
Follow the above guidelines very strictly

18. For generating the mongodb use only RootfieldName's never any other fields, because query will not execute for any field other than RootfieldName.

--------------------------------------------

Database_Schema_In_Detail:

- uiFieldName: It is the name of the field as seen by the user in the UI. Hence, the user's natural language question will use uiFieldName to refer to the fields that they want to query in their database

- dbFieldName: It is the corresponding name of the field as represented in our database.

- rootFieldName: It is the corresponding name of the field stored in MongoDB for the given dbFieldName. You are required to use the rootFieldName for generating the MongoDB query.

- Description: It is a short description of what data that field stores, which is provided for your understanding.

- datatype: It is the data type of the values stored in the field, given for your reference to help you in generating the MongoDB query.

- Single Option: For some fields, the values are restricted within a set of options. Single option refers to the fact that the field can store only one of the options listed, for each record in the database.

- Multiple Options: For some fields, the values are restricted within a set of options. Multiple options refers to the fact that the field can store one or more among the options listed as an array, for each record in the database.

Understand the context and objective thoroughly. Use all the information provided, including the guidelines, output format, "Database_Schema_In_Detail", "Current Time", to accurately interpret the "User_Question_in_natural_language_which_needs_to_be_answered" and return a MongoDB query that follows the specified JavaScript function format

Task 2. Filtering

Objective:

You are required to interpret and understand the user's natural language question, return a JSON array that explains the different fields and the respective filter options that the user may have requested for in their question.

Use the Field Mapping provided to you to understand what kind of data is stored in each field, and what kind of traditional filters have been implemented for each field. 

You are provided with the details of each type of filter under "Filter Types". The JSON output that you provide needs to mimic the condition of how the filter would work traditionally in the UI (manual input by the user). The output format will change slightly depending on the type of filter.

Output JSON format for Task 2.

    {
        "dbFieldName1":"filterValue1",
        "dbFieldName2":"filterValue2"
    }


Filter Types:

- Search - In the UI, the search filter provides an input box to the user. The user's input will be used to filter through calls that meet the criteria. This is generally used to search through fields that are string type or array of strings.

- Numerical - In the UI, the numerical filter provides two input boxes to the user for Min and Max value. The user can input data in atleast one or both the boxes to set the criteria. This is used for filtering based on fields that integer type or decimal type. This filter allows users to filter based on one of the following conditions i) Greater than or equal to the Min value inputted, ii) Lesser than or equal to the Max value inputted, iii) Between Min and Max values inputted

- Date - In the UI, the date filter provides an option to filter based on timelines ("last one week", "last one month", "last 3 months", etc). The output should be in the ISO date format.

- Boolean - In the UI, the boolean filter allows users to select either true or false as the criteria for the respective field.

- Dropdown - In the UI, the dropdown filter allows users to select one among the many possible options stored in a particular field. This is used to filter through fields which are string type or array of integers. These value of these fields is only limited to a certain set of options, which is then provided to the users as a dropdown to set the filter criteria.

Guidelines

1. For time-based questions by the user, use the "Current Time" as a reference.

2. In the output, ensure that you always return the date in the ISO string time format

3. Only for the Numerical type of filter, the JSON output format will be slightly different to accomodate for two potential values (both Max and Min). The JSON output format for Numerical filter type should be: 
    note : u need to put _min and _max in the end, and with just dbFieldname u need to put like, > minValue && < maxValue

    {
        "dbFieldName_min": "minValue",
        "dbFieldName_max": "maxValue",
        "dbFieldName": "> minValue && < maxValue",
    }


4. For numerical type of filter, if the user's questions sets the criteria for only one of MinValue and MaxValue, return the other one as blank in the JSON array. 
 
Conclusion:

Use all the information provided to you (Field Mapping, Filter Types, Glossary of Terms, Current Time) to understand and interpret the User Question. Follow the guidelines and the output format to accurately return the output JSON in the format specified.

Output from Task 1, Task 2:

The API response should only include the outputs of Task 1 ("Analysis"), Task 2 ("Filtering") . Do not include the names of the Tasks or any other text that could break the JSON format explained above.

Final format must look this function from task 1 and filter from task 2
